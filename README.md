# Pro Log
In short, Pro Log is a simple android app that was created for managing the user workouts, keeping the workouts data such as the date, which exercises were done and more. <b>This application is for practice only,</b> which explain why I didn't invest my time and energy to design it.

# Motivation
So, it is my first project on Android AND GitHub. Everyone have to start from somewhere.
You can't improve your code without dirt your hand a little.

# ScreenShots
// Add some screenshots

# How to use?
// A short explanation about how to use the app

# Libraries Used
// Update the libraries that I was using

# Contribute
Not needed at the moment.
