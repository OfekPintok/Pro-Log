# Pro Log
In short, Pro Log is a simple android app that was created for managing the user workouts, keeping the workouts data such as the date, which exercises were done and more. <b>This application is for practice only,</b> which explain why I didn't invest my time and energy to design it.

# Motivation
So, it is my first project on Android AND GitHub. Everyone has to start from somewhere.
You can't improve your code without dirt your hand a little.

# How to use?
In this specific explanation we will use Android Studio to compile and run the app.</br>
1.Download the project from GitHub.</br>
2.Open Android Studio and select the open tab from the File menu.</br>
3.Search for the location where the project was saved in, then double select it.</br>
4.Run the app (look for the green arrow icon or just press shift+F10 on windows).</br>
5.Select the device that you would like to use the app from.</br>
The project will be compiled on your device and then you ready to go.

# Libraries Used
1. <i>wdullaer datetimepicker</i>: has a dynamic date time picker, used to pick a date for a workout.
2. <i>gson</i>: used to serialize the sub-class of the workout (i.e exercises and worklines) so it would fit the database.
3. <i>room</i>: google's support library for sql, used to store the workouts.
and so on.

# Components Used
I chose some specific components to challange myself (and also because I had no choice :D ):
1. Expanded ListView and ListView: to show the data
2. Dialog Fragments: to add some UI
3. Shared References: To keep the settings and the default exercises list in a file
4. For database: ViewModel,RoomDataBase, Repository and Dao.
and so on.

# Contribute
Code review would be nice.
